Constructing decision trees from Fourier series


This code is used to test various algorithms for constructing decision trees that define the same function as a given Fourier series or that approximate the Fourier series.

The goal is to construct small decision trees that approximate Fourier series well.

Here we only consider Fourier series for functions from $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ to the real numbers.

An introduction to such Fourier series can be found here: https://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/gs001/gs001.pdf
